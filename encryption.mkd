#What is encryption?

Encryption is a way of scrambling data so that only authorized parties can understand the information.
In technical terms, it is the process of converting human-readable plaintext to incomprehensible text,
also known as ciphertext.

In simpler terms, encryption takes readable data and alters it so that it appears random.
Encryption requires the use of a cryptographic key: a set of mathematical values that both the
sender and the recipient of an encrypted message agree on.

Although encrypted data appears random, encryption proceeds in a logical, predictable way, allowing
a party that receives the encrypted data and possesses the right key to decrypt the data, turning it
back into plaintext. Truly secure encryption will use keys complex enough that a third party is
highly unlikely to decrypt or break the ciphertext by brute force â€” in other words, by guessing the key.

Data can be encrypted "at rest," when it is stored, or "in transit," while it is being transmitted somewhere else.

#What is a key in cryptography?

A cryptographic key is a string of characters used within an encryption algorithm for altering data so
that it appears random. Like a physical key, it locks (encrypts) data so that only someone with the right key
can unlock (decrypt) it.

#What are the different types of encryption?

The two main kinds of encryption are symmetric encryption and asymmetric encryption.
Asymmetric encryption is also known as public key encryption.

In symmetric encryption, there is only one key, and all communicating parties use the same (secret) key
for both encryption and decryption. In asymmetric, or public key, encryption,
there are two keys: one key is used for encryption, and a different key is used for decryption.
The decryption key is kept private (hence the "private key" name), while the encryption key is shared publicly,
for anyone to use (hence the "public key" name). Asymmetric encryption is a foundational technology for
TLS (often called SSL).

#Why is data encryption necessary?

> Privacy:
---
Encryption ensures that no one can read communications or data at rest except the intended recipient
or the rightful data owner. This prevents attackers, ad networks, Internet service providers, and
in some cases governments from intercepting and reading sensitive data.

> Security:
---
Encryption helps prevent data breaches, whether the data is in transit or at rest.
If a corporate device is lost or stolen and its hard drive is properly encrypted,
the data on that device will still be secure. Similarly, encrypted communications enable the communicating
parties to exchange sensitive data without leaking the data.

> Data integrity:
---
Encryption also helps prevent malicious behavior such as on-path attacks.
When data is transmitted across the Internet, encryption (along with other integrity protections)
ensures that what the recipient receives has not been tampered with on the way.

> Authentication:
---
Public key encryption, among other things, can be used to establish that a website's owner owns
the private key listed in the website's TLS certificate.
This allows users of the website to be sure that they are connected to the real
website (see What is public key encryption? to learn more).

> Regulations:
---
For all these reasons, many industry and government regulations require companies that handle user
data to keep that data encrypted. Examples of regulatory and compliance standards that require encryption
include HIPAA, PCI-DSS, and the GDPR.

#What is an encryption algorithm?

An encryption algorithm is the method used to transform data into ciphertext.
An algorithm will use the encryption key in order to alter the data in a predictable way,
so that even though the encrypted data will appear random, it can be turned back into plaintext
by using the decryption key.

#What are some common encryption algorithms?

Commonly used symmetric encryption algorithms include:

-   AES

-   3-DES

-   SNOW

Commonly used asymmetric encryption algorithms include:

-   RSA

-   Elliptic curve cryptography

#What is a brute force attack in encryption?

A brute force attack is when an attacker who does not know the decryption key attempts to
determine the key by making millions or billions of guesses.
Brute force attacks are much faster with modern computers, which is why encryption has to
be extremely strong and complex. Most modern encryption methods, coupled with high-quality passwords,
are resistant to brute force attacks, although they may become vulnerable to such attacks in the
future as computers become more and more powerful. Weak passwords are still susceptible to brute force attacks.
